Algovibes trading bot

The plan is to utilise all of the trading bots shown by Algovibes and compound them into one program.

First aim: Complete a mvp by utilising one trading strategy. The script/program will have the ability to perform backtesting, perform trades as set up and provide updates to a telegram bot.

Second aim: Add more trading strategies.

Third aim:  Make the code modular so it can accept different API's and strategies can be swapped.
Forth aim: Add all available trading strats.
5th aim: implement a UI so traders can choose a strat and change parameters.

There is another video here that relies on an SMA trading strategy, but also stops overlapping buys.

I shall be reviewing that video and updating this bot with its functionality.

I want to use this bot on a crypto exchange, and will begin work converting it once I have a mvp. Should be interesting to see what
can be done.
