Algovibes trading bot

The plan is to utilise all of the trading bots shown by Algovibes and compount them into one program.

First aim: Make the code modular so it can accept any input, strategies can be swapped.
Second aim: Add all available trading strats.
Third aim: implement a UI so traders can choose a strat and change parameters.

There is another video here that relies on an SMA trading strategy, but also stops overlapping buys.

I shall be reviewing that video and updating this bot with its functionality.

I want to use this bot on a crypto exchange, and will begin work converting it one. Should be interesting to see what
can be done.
